# bookworm-pdf-harvester
A Python program which will fetch PDF files from the web in bulk and create a zip file for Bookworm.

This was written so that many PDF documents could be fetched over the open web using lists of URLs. If you know of publicly available PDF documents which you want to ingest into the < https://github.com/Bookworm-project > this may get the job done.

I created a GitBook which explains how this works < http://tpmccallum.gitbooks.io/harvesting-pdf-files-from-the-web-for-use-in-book/ >

Please contact me if you require assistance.
